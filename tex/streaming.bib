	abstract = {Random subcloning strategies are commonly employed for analyzing pieces of DNA that are too large for direct analysis. Such strategies are applicable to gene finding, physical mapping, and DNA sequencing. Random subcloning refers to the generation of many small, directly analyzable fragments of DNA that represent random fragments of a larger whole, such as a genome. Following analysis of these fragments, a map or sequence of the original target may be reconstructed. Mathematical modeling is useful in planning such strategies and in providing a reference for their evaluation, both during execution and following completion. The statistical theory necessary for constructing these models has been developed independently over the last century. This paper brings this theory together into a statistical model for random subcloning strategies. This mathematical model retains its utility even at high subclone redundancies, which are necessary for project completion. The discussion here centers on shotgun sequencing, a random subcloning strategy envisioned as the method of choice for sequencing the human genome.},

Building on earlier works, we design a de Brujin graph based assembly algorithm which can achieve very close to the lower bound for repeat statistics of a wide range of sequenced genomes, including the GAGE datasets. The results are based on a set of necessary and sufficient conditions on the DNA sequence and the reads for reconstruction. The conditions can be viewed as the shotgun sequencing analogue of Ukkonen-Pevzner's necessary and sufficient conditions for Sequencing by Hybridization.},

In such projects, the physical map is assembled by first "fingerprinting" a large number of clones chosen at random from a recombinant library and then inferring overlaps between clones with sufficiently similar fingerprints. Although the basic approach is the same, there are many possible choices for the fingerprint used to characterize the clones and the rules for declaring overlap. In this paper, we derive simple formulas showing how the progress of a physical mapping project is affected by the nature of the fingerprinting scheme. Using these formulas, we discuss the analytic considerations involved in selecting an appropriate fingerprinting scheme for a particular project.},

Results: This article addresses the practical aspects of de novo assembly by introducing new ways to perform quality assessment on a collection of sequence reads. The software implementation calculates per-base error rates, paired-end fragment-size distributions and coverage metrics in the absence of a reference genome. Additionally, the software will estimate characteristics of the sequenced genome, such as repeat content and heterozygosity that are key determinants of assembly difficulty.

	abstract = {Sequencing technologies have placed a wide range of genomic analyses within the capabilities of many laboratories. However, sequencing costs often set limits to the amount of sequences that can be generated and, consequently, the biological outcomes that can be achieved from an experimental design. In this Review, we discuss the issue of sequencing depth in the design of next-generation sequencing experiments. We review current guidelines and precedents on the issue of coverage, as well as their underlying considerations, for four major study designs, which include de novo genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome sequencing and genomic location analyses (for example, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) and chromosome conformation capture (3C)).
